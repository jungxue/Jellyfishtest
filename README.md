Codes on jellyfish data

tried to workout GO Groupings using pubilically avaliable summary data, for raw data you must request it from original research. 

The goal is simpliy to form grouping, not working out Gene Enrichment Score from summary data, so a simple proportion count was used to rank most "significant" groupings. Will try gese function from Bioconductor package "phenoTest" if I had time and see how results compare to the original study.
