Codes on jellyfish data

tried to workout GO Groupings using pubilically avaliable summary data, for raw data you must request it from original research. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09681-1 

The goal is simpliy to try if I can form grouping, not working out Gene Enrichment Score from summary data, so a simple proportion count was used to rank most "significant" groupings. Will try gese function from Bioconductor package "phenoTest" if I had time and see how results compare to the original study.
